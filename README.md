# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sofia Egan.

I'm a high schooler in the Boston area. I go to a lot of hackathons and I'm working on running my own this spring! I enjoy working with a diverse range of platforms and technologies, including apps, websites, games, and random ML and data analysis projects in Python.
