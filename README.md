# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sofia Egan.

I'm a high schooler in the Boston area. I go to a lot of hackathons and I'm working on running my own this spring! I enjoy working with a diverse range of platforms and technologies, including apps, websites, games, and random ML and data analysis projects in Python.

## Projects

### [Upcoming Events Board](https://devpost.com/software/upcoming-events-board) - HackTheCastle Hackathon (January 2023)
  The Upcoming Events Board allows anyone to organize a local activity and get to know the people in their town, especially people who might be similar to themselves. This lets people such as new immigrants make connections in their new country of residence and find possible opportunities.

### [Snow Day Sledding](https://github.com/EerierGosling/BBN-Hackathon--Sledding-Skating-and-Skiing) ([presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1acBdPOdk9REWFreQ4EXicJParBPiaYJC-Tnyn3GmBP0/edit?usp=sharing) - BB&N Hackathon (January 2023)
  We built an app that lets you see all the sledding, skating, and skiing areas near you! The user can earn XP as they travel to each location.
